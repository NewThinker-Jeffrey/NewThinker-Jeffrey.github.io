## 李群李代数一些有趣的问题

### 李群与李代数的对应
- [Does every Lie algebra have a Lie group? (Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group%E2%80%93Lie_algebra_correspondence)
Lie's third theorem: Every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of some **simply connected** Lie group.
Lie groups that are isomorphic to each other have Lie algebras that are isomorphic to each other, but the converse is not necessarily true.  One obvious counterexample is $\mathbb {R} ^{n}$ and ${\mathbb  {T}}^{n}$. However, by restricting our attention to the **simply connected** Lie groups, the Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence will be one-to-one

### 李群与矩阵李群的对应
- [Are all Lie groups Matrix Lie groups?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1553270/are-all-lie-groups-matrix-lie-groups)  
一般而言单连通李群不是矩阵群。
一个拓扑空间的universal cover是其"最大"的covering space，universal cover都是单连通的（单连通空间自己是自己的universal cover）。很多矩阵群的universal cover都不再是矩阵群，典型如$SL_2(\mathbb {R})$。
但也不都是这样，SO3是非单连通的矩阵群（[How to demonstrate 𝑆𝑂(3) is not simply connected?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/22975/how-to-demonstrate-so3-is-not-simply-connected)），单位四元数群 (≅$S^3$3维球面群) 是单连通的且他是SO3的universal cover（[Universal covering of 𝑆𝑂](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/117569/universal-covering-of-so3-mathbbr)），但它却依然能表示为矩阵群，因为$S^3$ ≅𝑆𝑈(2) 。
**NO**. Counter examples: The universal cover $SL_2(\mathbb {R})$ and the metaplectic group
However it is true that all compact Lie groups are matrix groups, as a consequence of the Peter-Weyl theorem.
It is also true that every finite-dimensional Lie group has a finite-dimensional Lie algebra 𝔤 which is a matrix algebra. (This is Ado's theorem.)
Finite-dimensional Lie algebras are in bijective correspondence with finite-dimensional simply-connected Lie groups. So given an arbitrary Lie group 𝐺, passing to its Lie algebra amounts to passing to the universal cover of the connected component of the identity 𝐺1˜. Note though that **simply-connected Lie groups are not in general matrix groups**;  𝑆𝐿2(ℝ)˜ is a counterexample.
> [Metaplectic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplectic_group) The metaplectic group 𝑀𝑝2(ℝ) is not a matrix group: it has no **faithful finite-dimensional representations**. Therefore, the question of its explicit realization is nontrivial. It has faithful irreducible infinite-dimensional representations, such as the Weil representation described below.

- [When is a finite dimensional real or complex Lie Group not a matrix group](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/64195/when-is-a-finite-dimensional-real-or-complex-lie-group-not-a-matrix-group)
By Ado's theorem, every abstract finite dimensional Lie algebra over $\mathbb {R}, \mathbb {C}$ is the Lie algebra of some matrix Lie group. 
**All Lie groups with a given Lie algebra are covers of one another**, so even groups that are not subsets of $GL(V)$ $(V=\mathbb {R}, \mathbb {C})$ are covers of matrix groups.

### 李群上的指数映射与黎曼流形上的指数映射的对应

- **黎曼流形上的指数映射与李代数到李群上的指数映射 Compare Riemannian exponential map and Lie exponential map**
[Comparison with Riemannian exponential map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)#Comparison_with_Riemannian_exponential_map)
If G is compact, it has a Riemannian metric invariant under left and right translations, and the Lie-theoretic exponential map for G coincides with the exponential map of this Riemannian metric.
For a general G, there will not exist a Riemannian metric invariant under both left and right translations. Although there is always a Riemannian metric invariant under, say, left translations, the exponential map in the sense of Riemannian geometry for a left-invariant metric will not in general agree with the exponential map in the Lie group sense. That is to say, if G is a Lie group equipped with a left- but not right-invariant metric, the geodesics through the identity will not be one-parameter subgroups of G
[Relationships to exponential maps in Lie theory]()
In the case of Lie groups with a **bi-invariant metric**—*a pseudo-Riemannian metric invariant under both left and right translation*—the exponential maps of the pseudo-Riemannian structure are the same as the exponential maps of the Lie group. 
In general, Lie groups **do not** have a bi-invariant metric, though all connected semi-simple (or reductive) Lie groups do. The existence of a bi-invariant Riemannian metric is stronger than that of a pseudo-Riemannian metric, and implies that the Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group; conversely, **any compact (or abelian) Lie group** has such a Riemannian metric.
